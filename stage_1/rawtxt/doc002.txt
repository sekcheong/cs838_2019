Barrass was drafted by West Coast with pick 43 of the 2013 national draft, their third selection.[5] On arrival at the club he expressed interest in eventually filling a leadership position.[3] In January, prior to the 2014 AFL season, Barrass underwent an arthroscopy to repair a torn hip joint, ruling him out of training for three months.[6] He returned in April to play his first game for East Perth reserves (West Coast's WAFL affiliate). Playing slightly over half the match, Barrass amassed 17 possessions.[7] He played a further seven reserves games for the year.[1]

Barrass made his WAFL senior debut against Peel Thunder in round 5 of the 2015 season, recording nine marks.[8] Gavin Bell, West Coast's Head of Development, was impressed with Barrass's performance and noted his marking and ball use as standouts.[9] Teammate Josh Hill likened him to fellow defender Jeremy McGovern for his intercept marking and ability to "read" the play,[10] a comparison later echoed by teammate Mark LeCras.[11] In July, coach Adam Simpson said Barrass was ready to play at AFL level, but noted the backline was "pretty settled" and it would be hard for the defender to claim a spot.[12] After McGovern hurt his left hamstring against Collingwood, Barrass replaced him in the senior side against Sydney in round 17 of the 2015 AFL season.[11][13] On debut, he recorded 15 disposals and five marks.[13] Simpson was happy with Barrass's performance, saying "it's good to get exposure in such a big game", and noted the side's scarcity of key defenders after Will Schofield injured his calf. Fellow backman Xavier Ellis praised his efforts to play on dual Brownlow medallist Adam Goodes.[14] Barrass played two more matches to end the year; round 18 versus Gold Coast and round 22 against Adelaide.[13]

Barrass missed the first half of the 2016 AFL season but replaced Eric Mackenzie in round 12 after the defender fell ill. In July he was named as one of West Coast's key players under 23 by AFL.com.au journalist Alex Malcolm.[15] He retained his spot for the majority of the second half of the season,[13] culminating in a 2016 AFL Rising Star nomination after a twenty-nine point win against Adelaide in round 23. Barrass recorded seventeen disposals at 94.1% efficiency, ten spoils and ten marks, six of them interceptions.[16][17] He polled one Brownlow vote for the performance.[18] Barrass said he had been galvanised by his previous match against Adelaide in 2015, when he had been outplayed by their forwards.[19] He went on to play in his first AFL finals series, but only managed an elimination final after West Coast were knocked out by the Western Bulldogs. Barrass had eleven disposals and took six marks;[13] his performance was rated a 6 out of 10 by AFL.com.au journalist David Reed, who noted he improved after a slow start on Tom Boyd and took several crucial marks.[20] Post-season, Barrass won West Coast's Rookie of the Year award.[21]
