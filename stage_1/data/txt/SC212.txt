Tory expert denies defeatism

 The Conservatives' campaign director has denied a report claiming he warned <name>Michael Howard</name> the party could not win the next general election.

The Times on Monday said Australian <name>Lynton Crosby</name> told the party leader to focus on trying to increase the Tories' Commons presence by 25 to 30 seats. But Mr <name>Crosby</name> said in a statement: "I have never had any such conversation... and I do not hold that view." Mr <name>Howard</name> later added there was not "one iota" of truth in the report. The strategist helped Australia's PM, <name>John Howard</name>, win four elections. Mr <name>Howard</name> appointed Mr <name>Crosby</name> as his elections chief last October. Mr <name>Crosby</name>'s statement said: "The Conservative Party has been making an impact on the issues of lower tax and controlled immigration over the past week." It added: "The Labour Party will be wanting to do all they can to distract attention away from the issues that really matter to people."
