Tory expert denies defeatism

 The Conservatives' campaign director has denied a report claiming he warned <N>Michael Howard</N> the party could not win the next general election.

The Times on Monday said Australian <N>Lynton Crosby</N> told the party leader to focus on trying to increase the Tories' Commons presence by 25 to 30 seats. But Mr <N>Crosby</N> said in a statement: "I have never had any such conversation... and I do not hold that view." Mr <N>Howard</N> later added there was not "one iota" of truth in the report. The strategist helped Australia's PM, <N>John Howard</N>, win four elections. Mr <N>Howard</N> appointed Mr <N>Crosby</N> as his elections chief last October. Mr <N>Crosby</N>'s statement said: "The Conservative Party has been making an impact on the issues of lower tax and controlled immigration over the past week." It added: "The Labour Party will be wanting to do all they can to distract attention away from the issues that really matter to people."
