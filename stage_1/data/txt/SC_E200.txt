Celebrities get to stay in jungle. 

All four contestants still remain in I'm A Celebrity ... Get Me Out Of Here as no evictions were made on the television show on Saturday.

Contestants <N>Paul Burrell</N>, <N>Joe Pasquale</N>, <N>Janet Street-Porter</N> and <N>Fran Cosgrave</N> were told by hosts Ant and Dec. <N>Natalie Appleton</N>'s decision to quit the show last Monday had given them all a stay of execution, the group were told. Model Sophie Anderton was the last person to be voted off the ITV1 show, set in the Australian jungle. The four remaining stars will do a joint Bushtucker Trial on Sunday.

Former All Saints singer <N>Natalie Appleton</N>,31, walked out of the show after learning she would face a fifth so-called Bushtucker Trial. The celebrities are chosen by the viewers to pass trials in order to win food for the rest of the camp. <N>Appleton</N> had endured a torrid time during the programme, including a well-publicised row with <N>Sophie Anderton</N>. And on 26 November singer <N>Brian Harvey</N> quit as a contestant after he had a blazing row with <N>Janet Street-Porter</N>.
