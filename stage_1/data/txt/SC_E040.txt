Wine comedy up for six film gongs. 

Sideways, a wine-tasting comedy starring <N>Paul Giamatti</N>, is up for six Independent Spirit Awards, the art-house version of the Oscars. 

The awards are held on 26 February, the day before the Oscars. Spanish drama Maria Full of Grace, about a Colombian woman who becomes a drug courier, got five nominations. Controversial biopic Kinsey, starring <N>Liam Neeson</N> as sex researcher <N>Alfred Kinsey</N>, was one of four films to get four nominations. The awards, now in their 20th year, honour quirky low-budget films, all of which must have a degree of independent financing. Sideways is written and directed by <N>Alexander Payne</N>, who directed the 2002 hit About <N>Schmidt</N>, winning <N>Jack Nicholson</N> his 12th Academy Award nomination.

"These awards, for better or worse, mean everything," said Sideways producer <N>Michael London</N>, adding they were a "huge first step" toward getting recognition from other awards. Among the other films receiving four nominations apiece were Brother to Brother, a drama about a young gay black man forced to live on the streets, Robbing Peter and Primer. Primer, a $7,000 (Â£3,650) tale of discovery, won top prize at the Sundance film festival earlier this year. <N>Walter Salles</N> critically acclaimed The Motorcycle Diaries and the forthcoming thriller The Woodsman, starring <N>Kevin Bacon</N>, received three nominations each. Also in the running, with two nominations, are high school comedy Napoleon Dynamite, The Door in the Floor and Garden State - written, directed and starring Scrubs star <N>Zach Braff</N> alongside <N>Natalie Portman</N>. The awards were announced by actors <N>Selma Blair</N> and <N>Dennis Quaid</N> in Los Angeles on Tuesday.
