Potter director signs Warner deal

. <name>Harry Potter</name> director <name>Alfonso Cuaron</name> has signed a three-year deal with Hollywood studio Warner Brothers, according to Variety trade magazine.

The Mexican film-maker, who directed <name>Harry Potter</name> and the Prisoner of Azkaban, will produce mainstream movies and smaller Spanish-language films. "We had a wonderful experience with <name>Alfonso</name> on <name>Harry Potter</name>," Warner producer <name>Jeff Robinov</name> told Variety. <name>Cuaron</name>'s other films include Mexican movie Y Tu Mama Tambien.

The 2001 rites-of-passage drama about two teenage boys who embark on a relationship with an older woman, brought Cuaron international attention - and box office glory.

It also won him and his brother <name>Carlos</name>, with whom he co-wrote the screenplay, an Oscar nomination for best original screenplay. Warner will distribute <name>Cuaron</name>'s films in several languages outside the US. "This deal will give us the opportunity to collaborate with <name>Alfonso</name> on movies that make the most of his artistry and vision, and continue to offer him the mainstream worldwide audiences that our studio provides so successfully," said Mr <name>Robinov.</name>
His first film for Warner Brothers was 1995's family fantasy movie A Little Princess. Based on the novel by <name>Frances Hodgson Burnett</name>, A Little Princess tells the story of a young girl who is sent to live in a New York boarding school when her widowed father enlists for war. After the erotic nature of Y Tu Mama Tambien, Cuaron was a surprise choice to direct the third <name>Harry Potter</name> film but his dark interpretation was received well by the public and critics alike.
