More than 14 million people saw "Dirty" <name>Den Watts</name> killed off on Friday, marking EastEnders' 20th anniversary, according to unofficial figures.

Den's death came 16 years after he was supposedly shot in 1989. But he came back to the show in September 2003.

If the ratings are confirmed, the episode will have given the soap its highest audience for a year. The overnight figures showed almost 60% of the viewing public tuned into EastEnders between 2000 and 2100 GMT, leaving ITV1 with about 13%. "We are very pleased with the figures," a BBC spokesman said. "It shows viewers have really enjoyed the story of <name>Den</name>'s demise." The show's highest audience came at Christmas 1986, when more than 30 million tuned in to see <name>Den</name>, played by <name>Leslie Grantham</name>, hand divorce papers to wife <name>Angie</name>.

Two years later, 24 million saw him apparently shot by a man with a bunch of daffodils by a canal. More than 16 million viewers watched his return in 2003.
