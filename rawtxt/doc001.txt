Bohemian Rhapsody is a 2018 biographical film about Freddie Mercury, lead singer of the British rock band Queen. It follows the singer's life from when he joins the band in 1970 to their 1985 Live Aid performance at the former Wembley Stadium in London. A British-American venture, it was produced by 20th Century Fox, New Regency, GK Films, and Queen Films, with Fox serving as distributor. Directed by Bryan Singer, it was written by Anthony McCarten, and produced by Graham King and Queen manager Jim Beach. It stars Rami Malek as Mercury, with Lucy Boynton, Gwilym Lee, Ben Hardy, Joe Mazzello, Aidan Gillen, Tom Hollander, Allen Leech, and Mike Myers in supporting roles. Queen members Brian May and Roger Taylor served as creative and musical consultants.

Bohemian Rhapsody was announced in 2010, with Sacha Baron Cohen set to play Mercury. After he left the project in 2013 following creative differences with producers, the project languished for several years before Malek was cast in November 2016. Bryan Singer was the director through principal photography, which began in London in September 2017, but was fired in December 2017, for absence, and clashing with the cast and crew. Dexter Fletcher was hired to complete the film, although Singer retained sole director credit as per Directors Guild of America guidelines. Fletcher received an executive producer credit, and filming concluded in January 2018.

The film was released in the United Kingdom on 24 October 2018 and in the United States on 2 November 2018. It received mixed reviews from critics; its portrayals of Mercury's life and sexuality and of the other band members were criticised, but Malek's performance and the music sequences received praise.[8][9] The film also contains a number of historical inaccuracies.[10] It became a major box office success, grossing over $861 million worldwide on a production budget of about $50 million, becoming the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2018 worldwide and setting the all-time box office records for the biopic and drama genres.

Bohemian Rhapsody received numerous accolades, including a leading four awards at the 91st Academy Awards for Best Actor (Malek), Best Film Editing, Best Sound Editing and Best Sound Mixing; it was also nominated for Best Picture. The film also won Best Motion Picture – Drama at the 76th Golden Globe Awards, and was nominated for the Producers Guild of America Award for Best Theatrical Motion Picture and BAFTA Award for Best British Film, while Malek also won the Golden Globe, Screen Actors Guild and BAFTA awards for Best Actor.

Plot

In 1970 London, Farrokh "Freddie" Bulsara, an Indian Parsi refugee from Zanzibar, studies art at a college while working as a baggage handler at Heathrow Airport. At night, he often goes out with friends to listen to music. One night, after a show at a pub, Freddie goes to find the band, Smile, and with help from an attractive young woman in the hallway, Mary Austin, he finds the band outside and he compliments drummer, Roger Taylor and guitarist, Brian May on their performance. Learning that their lead singer, Tim Staffell, had just quit, Freddie offers himself as a replacement and demonstrates his vocal ability. Later, Freddie goes to Biba and sees Mary. She approaches and helps him choose some clothes, complimenting him on his style. They begin dating and move in together.

With the addition of Freddie as lead singer, and bassist John Deacon, the band play gigs across Britain, selling out at pubs and universities. Freddie urges the band to think bigger and record an album. After selling their van, they book time late at night in a studio to produce their debut album. While recording with experimental sounds and techniques, an A&R rep from EMI Records watches them. He asks RT, the sound engineer, for demos. Soon, Freddie changes the band's name to Queen and designs their logo. He also legally changes his name to Freddie Mercury.

The band signs with John Reid, Elton John's manager, and receives a contract with EMI. An appearance on Top of the Pops gives Queen a hit record, "Killer Queen". After touring to promote the album, Mary and Freddie become engaged. The album hits the charts in America, and, during the band's sold out U.S. tour, Freddie begins questioning his sexuality.

In 1975, Queen records their fourth album, A Night at the Opera, but leaves EMI when executive Ray Foster refuses to release the six-minute song "Bohemian Rhapsody" as the album's lead single. Freddie has DJ Kenny Everett debut the song on the radio. Despite mixed reviews, "Bohemian Rhapsody" becomes a smash hit. During the world tour, Freddie begins an affair with Paul Prenter, the band's Irish day-to-day manager. Mary breaks up with Freddie when he comes out to her as bisexual, although she assures him that he is gay. Despite this, they remain friends and she moves next door after he purchases an extravagant house in 1980.

The band's success continues, but tensions arise over the direction of their music and changes in Freddie's attitude resulting from his relationship with Paul. After a lavish party at his new home, Freddie falls for Jim Hutton, a waiter at the party. They soon part ways, with Jim telling Freddie to find him when he learns to like himself. Following a successful live show performing "We Will Rock You", Paul puts Reid up to proposing to Freddie that he should pursue a solo career and disband Queen, prompting Freddie to fire him without the consultation of the band, furthering the strain within the group. A press conference to promote the 1982 album, Hot Space, is hijacked by the press, who bombard Freddie with questions about his personal life and sexuality, to which Freddie responds with insults and refusals toward the press.

Freddie's relationship with his bandmates sours after the "I Want to Break Free" music video, in which the band appears in drag, is banned from MTV. He announces that he has signed a $4 million solo deal with CBS Records, effectively breaking up the band. He moves to Munich in 1984 to work on his first solo album, Mr. Bad Guy, and engages in gay orgies with Paul. Freddie becomes increasingly debauched from drugs and alcohol, and begins to become seriously ill. Mary, now pregnant by her new partner and increasingly concerned about Freddie, visits and urges him to return to the band, as they have been offered a spot in Bob Geldof's benefit concert, Live Aid at Wembley Stadium. Discovering that Paul withheld this news from him, an enraged Freddie severs ties with him. In retaliation, Paul goes public about Freddie's sexual escapades. Freddie returns to London to ask for forgiveness from his bandmates and new manager Jim Beach. They are reconciled and are given a last-minute slot in Live Aid. With the outbreak of HIV/AIDS spreading worldwide, Freddie discovers that he is infected with the disease. He reveals this to his bandmates during a rehearsal, and they embrace.

On the day of Live Aid, he is reunited with Hutton and Mary, and reconnects with his family and with his father's Zoroastrian maxim, "Good thoughts, good words, good deeds." The band perform at Live Aid, performing "Bohemian Rhapsody", "Radio Ga Ga", "Hammer to Fall" and "We Are the Champions". The Live Aid set is a massive success, helping increase the rate of donations during the event. The film ends with a statement confirming that Freddie would remain friends with Mary and Jim for the rest of his life. It explains he would die on 24 November 1991 at 45 from AIDS-related pneumonia, how the band hosted a tribute concert for him, and how the Mercury Phoenix Trust would be founded in his honour to help AIDS victims.

Production
Development

Plans for a film about Queen were revealed in September 2010 by the band's guitarist Brian May. Covering the period up to Live Aid in 1985, the film was to feature Sacha Baron Cohen as Freddie Mercury, with Graham King to co-produce, and Peter Morgan to write the screenplay.[19] May confirmed in April 2011 that the production was moving forward. He approved of Baron Cohen as Mercury, but also had reservations about the project's possible direction. The band's concerns focused on avoiding any harm to Mercury's legacy.[20]

In July 2013, Baron Cohen left the project due to creative differences. Allegedly, he had wanted a "gritty R-rated tell-all" focused on Mercury, while the band hoped for a PG-rated film about the band.[21] May said later in 2013 that Baron Cohen had left the project on good terms. Comments by May and Roger Taylor suggested that Baron Cohen was too well known as a comedian and prankster (due largely to his fictional personae Ali G and Borat), and that his presence in the film would be distracting.[22] In March 2016, Baron Cohen spoke about misunderstandings with Queen about the subject and events of the film, in particular whether the story ought to continue past Mercury's 1991 death. He also mentioned artistic disagreements with the band over the composition of the production team, referring specifically to the involvement of Morgan, David Fincher, and Tom Hooper.[23][24]

Following Baron Cohen's departure, in December 2013, Ben Whishaw was mentioned as a possible replacement to play Mercury. Also at this time, Dexter Fletcher was selected as the film's director.[25] Fletcher removed himself from the project early the following year, amid reports of creative disagreements with King.[26] In August 2014, Whishaw suggested that the film was not progressing well and that there had been scripting problems.[27] Whishaw left the project seven months later.[28] Rumours followed in 2015 that Baron Cohen had rejoined the project,[28] or that Whishaw might return.[29]

In November 2015, screenwriter Anthony McCarten became attached to the project, which now had the working title of Bohemian Rhapsody after Queen's song of the same name.[29] Developing a fresh take on the story from his interviews with May and Taylor, he delivered his first draft in February 2016. A year later, Bryan Singer was in talks to take over as director, Rami Malek was cast as Mercury, and the film was fast-tracked by 20th Century Fox and New Regency.[30] It was reported in 2015 that Johnny Flynn was due to play Roger Taylor, and that Gemma Arterton would play Mercury's partner Mary Austin.[31]

In May 2017, Malek confirmed that he had conducted recordings at Abbey Road Studios and had consulted Taylor and May.[32] The same month, Entertainment Weekly reported that Taylor and May were serving as music producers.[32] In August 2017, Justin Haythe was revealed to have penned another draft of the script.[33]

On 1 December 2017, The Hollywood Reporter reported that 20th Century Fox had temporarily halted production due to the "unexpected unavailability" of director Bryan Singer. Sources said that Singer had not returned to the set after the Thanksgiving week. Discussions began about replacing him, at which point cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel stepped in to direct during Singer's non-showings.[34] Singer's absence was reportedly due to "a personal health matter concerning Bryan and his family".[35] Other sources, however, claimed that Malek and the crew had grown tired of Singer's behaviour, who was reportedly arriving late to set and clashing with Malek.[36] On 4 December 2017, Singer was fired as director, with about two weeks of scheduled principal photography remaining.[37]

On 6 December 2017, Dexter Fletcher was announced as Singer's replacement[38] and on 15 December, filming resumed with Fletcher directing.[39] Fletcher later estimated that two-thirds of the principal photography had been completed when he joined the production, saying, "I came into the last few weeks of principal photography and editing and the bits and pieces like that... I was looking at two complete [acts] in a good film, and [I had to] not let it down."[40]
Casting

On 4 November 2016, it was announced that Rami Malek would star as Freddie Mercury.[41] The producers saw his work on Mr. Robot.[42] He had to make a pre-recording at Abbey Road Studios, which was sent to Queen members for approval.[43] On 21 August 2017, additional cast members were announced: Ben Hardy as drummer Roger Taylor, Gwilym Lee as lead guitarist Brian May, and Joseph Mazzello as bass guitarist John Deacon.[13] On 30 August 2017, it was reported that Allen Leech had been cast in the film to play Mercury's personal manager, Paul Prenter, who worked for him from 1977 to 1987, when he was fired for betraying Mercury by selling his personal information to UK newspapers.[14]

On 6 September 2017, Lucy Boynton was cast to play Mercury's long-term girlfriend, Mary Austin. Lindsey Stirling, Bryce Dallas Howard, Maria Bello and Ashley Johnson were also considered.[12] On 11 September 2017, Mike Myers joined the cast to play EMI executive Ray Foster,[16] and on 22 September 2017, Aaron McCusker was added to play Mercury's long-term boyfriend Jim Hutton.[17] On 26 September 2017, it was announced that Aidan Gillen had been cast as John Reid, Queen's second manager, from 1975 to 1978, who took over from Norman Sheffield of Trident Studios; while Tom Hollander was set to play Jim Beach, Queen's third manager, who took over from John Reid in 1978.[44] The film includes cameos by current Queen vocalist Adam Lambert as a truck driver and the film's editor John Ottman as a live TV director.[45][46]
Filming

Pre-production began in July 2017 in the United Kingdom, with principal photography commencing in London in September 2017.[47] Queen archivist Greg Brooks was instrumental in helping recreate each scene to make it as true to life as possible. He worked daily with Fox for months from the beginning, providing answers to questions.[48] There were about a hundred extras, who were all individually scanned 360° and digitally replicated to imitate a larger crowd.[46] The entire Live Aid performance was filmed, but in the final cut "We Will Rock You" and "Crazy Little Thing Called Love" were cut out.[46]

When Malek was contacted about playing Mercury, he had only a casual knowledge of Queen. To embody Mercury, Malek had to work many intense sessions with a movement coach (as well as learn to talk with prosthetic teeth).[49] Besides examining Mercury's movements, they also watched footage of Liza Minnelli, who was an inspiration to Mercury's stage moves.[50] Malek also took singing and piano lessons, and had an accent coach, as well.[50] He said, "I had to re-create things he did on the fly, onstage. There were many days I said to myself, 'This is a lost cause.'" After finishing the film, Malek said that he became a "Queen super-fan", specifying, "I see Freddie as the best performer of all time... I never ceased to be astonished by this man."[49] While Malek sang some parts in the film, producers inserted vocal stems from Queen songs as well as filling in parts with Canadian vocalist Marc Martel, a winner of the Queen Extravaganza Live Tour auditions.[49][51]

In December 2017, with under three weeks left on the shoot, director Bryan Singer requested a filming hiatus as his mother was extremely ill. Fox terminated Singer and hired Dexter Fletcher to step in as director the last two weeks of the film.[52] On 30 January 2018, Gwilym Lee posted to social media that filming had finished.[53] Visual effects were provided by DNEG and supervised by Paul Norris.[54]
Directing credit

According to the Directors Guild of America, only one director can be named for a film, and the DGA has sole control over who that will be.[40][55] Although Fletcher replaced Singer on the set before filming was completed, producer Graham King announced in June 2018 that Singer would receive the directing credit on the finished film. Fletcher received executive producer credit.[1][56]
Music
Main article: Bohemian Rhapsody: The Original Soundtrack

John Ottman, a frequent collaborator of Singer, composed the film's score. An official soundtrack album was released by Hollywood Records and Virgin EMI Records on CD, cassette, and digital formats on 19 October 2018. The album contains several Queen hits and 11 previously unreleased recordings, including five tracks from their 21-minute Live Aid performance in July 1985, which have never before been released in audio form. A vinyl release followed on 8 February 2019.[57][58][59]
Historical accuracy

Some historical events are portrayed out of order in the film; McCarten said this was for dramatic effect, saying: "We're making a movie here, not a documentary."[60]
Regarding the band

    The formation of Queen was not as simple as portrayed in the film.[10] Mercury had known Staffell from art college, and had shown an interest in joining the band prior to Staffell's departure.[61]
    John Deacon was not the original bassist, but the fourth.[10]
    The character of Ray Foster is fictional and loosely based on EMI chief Roy Featherstone. While Featherstone and others thought that "Bohemian Rhapsody" was too long to be released as a single, Featherstone was a fan of the band.[10]
    Mercury was not the first member of Queen to release a solo album: Taylor released Fun in Space in April 1981 and Strange Frontier in June 1984. May released Star Fleet Project in October 1983. Mercury's Mr. Bad Guy was released in April 1985.[62]
    Queen never split up, so Live Aid was not a reunion. They released The Works in early 1984 and then toured worldwide. The last show of the tour was eight weeks before Live Aid. They also had no reservations about performing in the concert in two weeks' notice, as depicted in the film.[10]

Regarding Mercury's personal life

    According to Vanity Fair, the film leaves out many details about Mercury's relationships with Mary Austin and Jim Hutton, "tweaking and glossing over precious facts".[63]
    Mercury did not meet Mary Austin on the same night he joined the band. Jim Hutton was not a server at one of Mercury's parties; he was a hairdresser at the Savoy Hotel who met Mercury at a nightclub.[10]
    The film's treatment of Mercury's HIV diagnosis received particular criticism,[64][65] with Jasper Rees describing it in The Spectator as "the most callous rearrangement of the facts".[66] The time at which Mercury learned he had HIV is disputed but is usually given as between 1986 and 1987, not before Live Aid in 1985 as depicted in the film.[10] The other band members were not made aware until 1989.[67]

Release

The world premiere of Bohemian Rhapsody took place in London at the SSE Arena, Wembley, on 23 October 2018.[68] It was released in the United Kingdom on 24 October 2018 in IMAX, and in the United States on 2 November 2018, by 20th Century Fox. The film was previously scheduled for release on 25 December 2018.[69] In November 2018, John Ottman announced in an interview that an extended version of the film with cut-out scenes may be released, in a yet unknown format.[46] On 1 January 2019, it was announced that there would be special sing-along screenings simultaneously in cinemas across the United Kingdom with the first screening at Leicester Square’s Prince Charles Cinema with others on 11 January 2019.[70][71] There were also many sing-along screenings in South Korea and Japan.[72]

In China, the film is set to have a limited release on 22 March 2019.[73] At least one minute of the film will reportedly be censored, including scenes portraying drugs and homosexuality;[74] Rami Malek's Oscar speech was earlier censored in China prior to the announcement of its release.[73]
Home media

20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released the film in the United States on DVD, Blu-ray and Ultra HD Blu-ray on 12 February 2019; with a digital version released 22 January. The UK digital release was scheduled for 16 February 2019, with DVD and Blu-ray/4K Ultra HD on 4 March 2019. The home release includes an extended version of the Live Aid sequence, a 16-minute featurette, a 22-minute documentary and trailers.[75][76][77] In the United States, 73% of unit sales in the first week were on Blu-ray Disc, with 13% from the 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray version.[78] In the United Kingdom, it surpassed Avengers: Infinity War to become the fastest-selling digital download film of all time, selling 265,000 downloads in eight days.[79]

The first trailer for the film was released on 15 May 2018 and with more than 5 million views in the first 24 hours, it was the top trending video on YouTube.[83] Television writer and producer Bryan Fuller argued that the trailer favours Mercury's relationship with women as opposed to men, and also highlighted the absence of the singer's AIDS diagnosis from the synopsis. Instead, it's simply referred to as "a life-threatening illness".[84] Executives stated that the film would acknowledge Mercury's gay relationships. With the release of the trailer, Queen reached three of the top 20 positions on Billboard's Hot Rock Songs chart: "Bohemian Rhapsody", "Another One Bites the Dust" and "We Are the Champions".[85]

On 11 June 2018, at CineEurope, an early showing of the film closed the show with appearances by Rami Malek and producer Graham King and special appearances by Brian May and Roger Taylor, who were playing a concert of Queen + Adam Lambert in Barcelona.[86]

It was announced on 6 September 2018 that the film would receive a PG-13 rating in the United States by the MPAA.[87]

The website's critical consensus reads: "Bohemian Rhapsody hits a handful of high notes, but as an in-depth look at a beloved band, it offers more of a medley than a true greatest hits collection."[117] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 49 out of 100, based on 50 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".[118] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it an 88% positive score and a 75% "definite recommend".[6] The critical response to Bohemian Rhapsody made it one of the worst-reviewed films to win a Best Picture award at the Golden Globe Awards (lowest Rotten Tomatoes score since Out of Africa in 1986, with a 60%), as well as to be nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards (worst since Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close in 2012, with a 46%).[119][120]

Owen Gleiberman of Variety wrote: "Rami Malek does a commanding job of channeling Freddie Mercury's flamboyant rock-god bravura, but Bryan Singer's middle-of-the-road Queen biopic rarely lives up to the authenticity of its lead performance."[121] Paul Whitington, writing for the Irish Independent, gave the film 3/5 stars, saying: "Bohemian Rhapsody is not big on subtlety: it tells Freddie's story loudly, taking dramatic shortcuts, over-neatly conflating events and reducing most of the surrounding characters to single dimensions. Some of the dialogue's a bit heavy-handed too, but I must say I was thoroughly entertained."[122] For the Evening Standard, Craig McLean wrote: "Bohemian Rhapsody is triumphant entertainment. The post-production special effects have done their job: the Live Aid scenes are convincingly epic. The actors have done their job, too, notably Malek, who oozes pure Mercury."[123] For Time, Stephanie Zacharek wrote: "In strict filmmaking terms, Bohemian Rhapsody is a bit of a mess. Some of its scenes connect awkwardly, and it hits every beat of disaster and triumph squarely, like a gong. Yet if it has many of the problems we associate with 'bad' movies, it has more ragged energy than so many good ones, largely because of Rami Malek’s performance as Mercury, all glitter and muscle and nerve endings." She described it as "a movie for sensualists, not quality-control experts".[124]

Chief Guardian pop critic Alexis Petridis described the portrayal of Mercury as "sanitised", writing: "Bohemian Rhapsody is a film that plays so fast and loose with the truth, it ends up seeming faintly ridiculous: you start out nitpicking about minor chronological errors... and end up with your jaw on the floor."[125] Guardian film critic Steve Rose described it as a "rock slog with a troubling moralistic subtext".[126] Although he praised Malek's performance, David Ehrlich of IndieWire gave the film a grade of "D+", criticising Singer's direction and calling the film "royally embarrassing". He wrote: "Queen's music may have been unclassifiable, but their movie is as trite and textbook as it gets." He described the film as a "terrible and self-indulgent piece of revisionist history, where the legend is always prioritized over the truth, even when the truth was surely far more interesting."[127] For The Spectator, Jasper Rees described Bohemian Rhapsody as "a succession of predigested clichés", writing "you are overcome by the sapping impression that almost nothing happened the way it's being presented." He concluded: "The costumes and wigs are splendid, and the songs are still up to snuff. But this homage to a showman is more famine than feast."[66] Olly Richards wrote for Empire that the film was "a safe, competent, decidedly non-scandalous biopic. It treats the life of Freddie Mercury with cautious affection, happy to play within the rules when depicting a man who did anything but." However, he described Malek as "spectacular", concluding: "If the script hits a lot of bum notes, Malek is always perfectly in key."[128]

Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote: "In struggling to make a salable PG-13 movie out of an R-rated rock life, Bohemian Rhapsody leaves you feeling that something essential and elemental is missing", but said to put Malek "high on the list for best film performances of 2018," as the actor "digs so deep into the role that we can't believe we’re not watching the real thing."[129] Dave Calhoun wrote for Time Out: "It boasts a film-stealing, possessed performance by Rami Malek, who pouts, struts and quips as Mercury, turning the rest of the cast into bit-part players... The movie, though catchy and often seductive, is an act of brazen myth-making. Facts and chronology are tossed aside in favour of a messianic storyline... Much is left out, or fiddled with." He added "don’t expect anything more than a safe gloss over the Queen tale... its attitude toward sex and drugs is coy and uncomfortably close to the small-world thinking it claims to dismiss."[130] Despite calling the film "uneven," Chicago Tribune film critic Katie Walsh stated: "Malek keeps it going with his sheer will and talent."[131] In a negative movie review, Soumya Srivastava of the Hindustan Times still asserted that the character was "played to a toothy perfection by Rami Malek."[132] Johnny Oleksinski of the New York Post was less impressed with Malek's performance, writing: "It's a surface-level performance — physically galvanizing, but with no substance."[133]

The film also received criticism for its portrayal of Mercury's gay relationships. Aja Romano wrote for Vox: “Bohemian Rhapsody is a movie that consciously tries to position a gay man at its center while strategically disengaging with the 'gay' part as much as it can, flitting briefly over his emotional and sexual experiences and fixating on his platonic relationship with an ex-girlfriend instead."[134] Likewise, Olly Richards wrote: "There are some poor, strange choices when deciding where to focus, not least committing so much time to his relationship with Mary Austin and virtually none to any happy gay relationship, romantic or otherwise."[128] Owen Gleiberman wrote that the film "treats Freddie's personal life – his sexual-romantic identity, his loneliness, his reckless adventures in gay leather clubs – with kid-gloves reticence, so that even if the film isn't telling major lies, you don't feel you're fully touching the real story either."[121]

On the film's critical reviews, Brian May responded: "The mistake that critics made was reviewing the trailer instead of reviewing the film. They jumped to conclusions. Once people stake their claim, it's hard for them to withdraw."[135]
